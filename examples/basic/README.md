# Overview

This example shows how to use [Workit](https://villedemontreal.github.io/workit/) to create a simple Node.js application - e.g. a worker that executes a simple task. You will learn how to use Camunda BPM platform as well as Zeebe

Have fun!

## Installation

```sh
$ # from this directory
$ npm install
```

(Optional) Setup, we can switch to `TAG.camundaBpm` or `TAG.zeebe` in order to use both plateform (some comments are added in the example).

```sh
$ # from this directory
$ npm run build
```

## Run the Application

```sh
$ # from this directory
$ # deploy a bpmn provided in the example
$ npm camunda:deploy
$ # create instance(s)
$ npm camunda:create-instance
$ # run worker
$ npm camunda:worker
```
