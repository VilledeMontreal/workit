# Overview

Examples show how to use [Workit](https://villedemontreal.github.io/workit/) to create a simple Node.js application - e.g. a worker that executes a simple task.

You can also combine different examples into one - e.g you want to use [OpenTelemetry](opentelemetry) and [Camunda Cloud](camunda-cloud).

Have fun!

## Installation

```sh
$ # inside a directory
$ npm install
```

(Optional) Setup, we can switch to `TAG.camundaBpm` or `TAG.zeebe` in order to use both plateform (some comments are added in examples when BPMN is available see [basic example](basic)). 

## Run the Application

```sh
$ # inside a directory

$ # deploy a bpmn provided in the example
$ npm camunda:deploy
$ # create instance(s)
$ npm camunda:create-instance
$ # run worker
$ npm camunda:worker
```
